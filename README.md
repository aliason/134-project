# Statistical Data Science Final Project

This project aims to apply data science concepts and techniques learned in class – latent factor modeling, optimization algorithms, kernel density estimation, regularization and clustering algorithms – to real-world datasets. In doing so, I will utilize several machine learning libraries (seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, altair) to facilitate data processing, analysis, and visualization. 

Note that Question 3c onward are not required for PSTAT 134 students and are thus left empty.
