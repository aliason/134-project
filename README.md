# Movie Recommendation System

## Project description
This repository contains the code for the final course project of PSTAT 134 (Statistical Data Science) at the University of California, Santa Barbara taken in Fall 2023. Students implement collaborative filtering algorithms to generate movie recommendations based on user affinities, illustrating advanced machine learning techniques such as matrix factorization, dimensionality reduction, optimization, and clustering. Problems are given in a guided format and incrementally checked for correctness. 

Models are implemented in Python, using data science libraries (pandas, altair, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn) to facilitate data processing, visualization, and evaluation. Note that questions 3c-4c are optional and left empty.
