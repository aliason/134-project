# Statistical Data Science Final Project

The aim of this project is to apply data sceince principles learned in class – latent factor modeling, optimization algorithms, model diagnostics, density estimation, regularization, and clustering algorithms – to real-world datasets provided by the professor. In doing so, we utilize several statistical modules / packages such as seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and altair in data processing, restructuring, analysis, and visualization. 

We operate on two datasets – a small dataset and a large dataset – containing user, movie, and ratings information, and utilize several metrics to examine the predictive accuracy of our models.

Note that Question 3c onward are intended for PSTAT 234 students and optional.
